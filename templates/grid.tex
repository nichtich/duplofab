The following grid can be used to design \textbf{DUPLO compatible plates}. It
shows the basic $16$mm grid with nobs (diameter $9.6$mm) and build areas of
several 3D printers and the smallest size of Ponoko and related 2D cutting
services.% its partners: RazorLAB, Formulor, and Vectorealism

Markble track dimensions:
The bars should not be tight, so I choose make them $12$mm diameter (including an expected
$0.25$mm laser cutter width. Marble holes are $16$mm diameter and marble tracks $12$mm, so
marbles should have diameter between $13$ and $15$mm.
