The following grid can be used to design \textbf{DUPLO compatible plates}. It
shows the basic $16$mm grid with nobs (diameter $9.6$mm) and build areas of
MakerBot Cupcake~CNC ($100\times 100$mm), Thing-O-Matic ($96\times 108$mm), and
Replicater ($145 \times 225$mm), and the smallest standard size of Ponoko (and
its partners RazorLAB, Formulor, and Vectorealism) ($181\times 181$mm).

\begin{tikzpicture}

\begin{scope}[dotted]
% duplo matrix
\draw[step=16mm] (0,0) grid (176mm,224mm);

\foreach \x [evaluate = \x as \xp using ((\x-0.5) * 16)] in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}{
  \foreach \y [evaluate = \y as \yp using ((\y-0.5) * 16)] in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14}{
    \draw (\xp mm,\yp mm) circle (4.8mm);

The bars should not be tight, so I choose make them $12$mm diameter (including an expected
$0.25$mm laser cutter width. Marble holes are $16$mm diameter and marble tracks $12$mm, so
marbles should have diameter between $13$ and $15$mm.
