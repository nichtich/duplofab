This project contains some experiments with Lego DUPLO and personal fabrication.

# Background

## Design

Dimensions and more information about Lego and Duplo bricks can be found
at <http://www.robertcailliau.eu/Lego/>.

If you cut material you must think about the width of cuts, for instance
laser cutters burn away some material. I expect this to be about 0.25mm,
so I'd naturally get the required gap between parts.

Unfortunately I have not found a satisfying CAD software for 2D design,
so I started with Inkscape.

You can use any stable material but plywood might be the best choice.
2mm, 3mm, 4mm.

## Production

Either you have access to a 3D-printer, 2D-Cutter etc. or you must order the
parts at some service. I tried [formulor].
